# 🤖 Enterprise HRMS Multi-Agent Command Center & Quick Reference

> All available development skills, engineering practices, MCP tools, and specialized capabilities should be organized into a coordinated **Enterprise HRMS Multi-Agent Architecture**.
>
> The purpose of this command center is to build, maintain, secure, test, and continuously improve a **production-grade Human Resources Management System (HRMS)** suitable for organizations ranging from SMEs to large enterprises.
>
> **Core principle:** The system must be designed as an enterprise business platform—not merely an employee database or collection of HR forms.

# ⚡ Quick Agent Summon Guide

You can summon any specialized agent by including its handle or role in your prompt.

Agents must **not work blindly**.

Before modifying the system, the responsible agent should:

1. Understand the existing architecture.
2. Inspect the relevant files and dependencies.
3. Identify the business requirement.
4. Identify affected modules and data relationships.
5. Determine whether existing functionality can be reused.
6. Check for security, privacy, compliance, and authorization implications.
7. Identify regression risks.
8. Create an implementation plan when the task is complex.
9. Implement the smallest correct change.
10. Verify the result before claiming completion.

# 🧭 Enterprise HRMS Master Orchestrator

The **Master Orchestrator** coordinates the specialized agents.

It should not automatically delegate everything.

It must first determine:

### 1. What type of problem is this?

Examples:

* Architecture
* HR business process
* Payroll
* Attendance
* Leave
* Recruitment
* Performance
* Database
* Security
* Compliance
* UI/UX
* API
* Integration
* Performance
* QA
* DevOps
* Debugging
* Reporting
* Documents

### 2. Which agents are actually required?

Use the **minimum number of agents necessary**.

Do not create unnecessary work.

### 3. What is the dependency order?

Example:

```text
Business Requirement
        ↓
HR Domain Analysis
        ↓
Architecture
        ↓
Database / Data Model
        ↓
API / Backend
        ↓
Frontend / UX
        ↓
Security
        ↓
QA
        ↓
Performance
        ↓
Final Review
```

---

# 🧠 Enterprise Engineering Rules

Every agent must follow these rules.

## Rule 1 — Understand Before Changing

Before modifying code:

* Inspect the existing implementation.
* Understand the data flow.
* Understand dependencies.
* Identify shared components.
* Identify existing business rules.

---

## Rule 2 — Root Cause Before Fix

Do not immediately patch the visible symptom.

Determine:

```text
Symptom
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Execution Path
   ↓
Incorrect State
   ↓
Root Cause
   ↓
Correct Fix
   ↓
Regression Test
```

---

## Rule 3 — Preserve Existing Functionality

Do not rewrite working modules merely because a different implementation is preferred.

Before changing shared code ask:

> "What other HRMS modules depend on this?"

---

## Rule 4 — Business Rules Must Have a Single Source of Truth

Critical calculations must not be duplicated across:

* UI
* API
* Payroll
* Reports
* Mobile application

For example:

```text
Payroll Calculation Engine
        ↓
        ├── Payroll Preview
        ├── Final Payroll
        ├── Payslip
        ├── Payroll Reports
        └── Accounting Export
```

There should be one authoritative calculation model.

---

# 🔐 Enterprise Security Principles

The HRMS must assume that employee data is sensitive.

Security must include:

* Least privilege
* Role-based access
* Fine-grained authorization
* MFA where appropriate
* Encryption
* Secure sessions
* Audit logging
* Secret management
* Input validation
* Output encoding
* Secure file storage
* Data masking
* Tenant isolation
* Administrative auditing

Sensitive information should never be exposed merely because a user can access an employee page.

---

# 🏢 Enterprise Organizational Model

The architecture should support organizational structures such as:

```text
Enterprise
│
├── Company
│   │
│   ├── Branch
│   │
│   ├── Division
│   │
│   ├── Department
│   │
│   ├── Section
│   │
│   └── Team
│
├── Positions
│
├── Employees
│
└── Employment History
```

The exact hierarchy must remain configurable rather than assuming every organization has the same structure.

---

# 👤 Employee Lifecycle

The HRMS should model the employee lifecycle explicitly:

```text
Candidate
   ↓
Applicant
   ↓
Selected
   ↓
Offer
   ↓
Pre-Employment
   ↓
Onboarding
   ↓
Active Employee
   ↓
Transfer / Promotion / Assignment
   ↓
Leave / Suspension / Other Status
   ↓
Separation
   ↓
Former Employee
```

Historical information must remain traceable.

---

# 💰 Payroll Lifecycle

Payroll should follow a controlled workflow:

```text
Payroll Period
      ↓
Attendance Collection
      ↓
Leave Processing
      ↓
Overtime
      ↓
Adjustments
      ↓
Earnings
      ↓
Deductions
      ↓
Payroll Calculation
      ↓
Payroll Review
      ↓
Approval
      ↓
Finalization
      ↓
Payslip
      ↓
Accounting / Payment Export
      ↓
Audit Record
```

Finalized payroll must not be silently altered.

Corrections should create controlled adjustment records.

---

# 📝 Auditability

Important HRMS events should be auditable.

Examples:

* Employee created
* Employee updated
* Salary changed
* Position changed
* Department changed
* Leave approved
* Leave rejected
* Attendance corrected
* Payroll calculated
* Payroll approved
* Payroll finalized
* Payslip generated
* Employee terminated
* Permission changed
* HR record accessed

Audit information should answer:

```text
WHO
WHAT
WHEN
WHERE
BEFORE
AFTER
WHY
```

where appropriate and legally permissible.

---

# 🧪 Definition of Done

An agent must not say:

> "Fixed."

merely because the code was changed.

A feature is complete only when:

* Requirements are understood.
* Implementation is complete.
* Type checking passes.
* Relevant tests pass.
* Database changes are verified.
* Authorization is verified.
* Security implications are checked.
* Regression risks are reviewed.
* UI behavior is verified.
* Error states are handled.
* Existing functionality remains intact.
* Acceptance criteria pass.

---

# 🚨 Production-Critical Rule

For payroll, employee records, authentication, permissions, and other business-critical systems:

**Never make a destructive change without understanding its data impact.**

Before destructive operations:

```text
Backup
  ↓
Migration Plan
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Execution
  ↓
Verification
  ↓
Rollback Plan
```

---

# 🤝 Multi-Agent Collaboration

Agents can be combined in a single prompt.

### Example

> "@agent-hr-domain define the employee onboarding workflow, @agent-architect design the architecture, @agent-database design the schema, @agent-api-architect define the API contracts, @agent-expert-fullstack implement it, @agent-security verify authorization, @agent-qa create the regression tests, and @agent-reviewer perform the final code review."

The Master Orchestrator should execute the work in dependency order rather than allowing agents to make conflicting changes simultaneously.

---

# ⚡ Token Efficiency Protocol (Minimal Token, Maximum Result)

1. **High Signal, Zero Fluff**: Strip conversational padding and preambles. Output only direct, high-value technical findings, code, paths, and diagnostics.
2. **Lean Context Ingestion**: Pinpoint lines via targeted grep before viewing. Use narrow line ranges (`StartLine`/`EndLine`). Never dump raw logs or whole files into context.
3. **Surgical Patching**: Modify only the precise lines required via surgical diffs. Avoid full-file rewrites.
4. **Investigate First**: Understand architecture and dependencies before changing code.
5. **Verify and Stop**: As soon as requirements, type checks, and tests pass, stop tool execution and conclude immediately without side-effect tasks.
